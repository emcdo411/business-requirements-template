# Business Requirements Document (BRD) Template

## Project Overview
This Business Requirements Document (BRD) outlines the requirements for the implementation of a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system for a retail company. The CRM will integrate with the company's existing e-commerce platform (Shopify) to streamline sales processes, enhance customer engagement, and provide valuable insights into customer behavior.

---

## 1. Executive Summary

### Overview
The project aims to implement a CRM solution to automate customer data management, improve sales team productivity, and personalize customer interactions. The CRM will integrate with the company’s existing e-commerce platform (Shopify) and provide insights into customer purchasing behavior.

### Scope
The project will cover the implementation of the CRM system, integration with Shopify, customer data migration, and user training. The solution must be scalable, mobile-friendly, and provide real-time customer insights.

---

## 2. Project Background

### Business Problem/Opportunity
The company currently uses manual methods to track customer interactions, leading to inefficiencies and missed sales opportunities. The CRM system will centralize and automate customer data management, improving sales performance and customer retention.

### Objectives
- Increase sales team productivity by 20%.
- Reduce customer churn by 15% within 12 months.
- Enhance customer satisfaction by providing personalized marketing and communication.

### Key Stakeholders
- **Sales Team**: Primary users for managing customer interactions.
- **Marketing Team**: Users of customer insights for campaign creation.
- **IT Team**: Responsible for ensuring CRM and e-commerce integration.
- **Management**: Sponsors overseeing project success.

---

## 3. Scope of Work

### In-Scope
- Implement CRM solution (Salesforce).
- Integrate with e-commerce platform (Shopify).
- Migrate customer data from legacy systems.
- Provide user training to sales and marketing teams.

### Out-of-Scope
- Development of new e-commerce features.
- Internationalization of the CRM for non-U.S. markets.
- Customization of the mobile app for customer-facing interactions.

---

## 4. Functional Requirements

### Use Cases / User Stories
- **Sales Representative**: "As a sales rep, I want to view a customer’s purchase history so that I can tailor my sales pitch."
- **Marketing Manager**: "As a marketing manager, I want to segment customers based on purchasing behavior to send targeted email campaigns."

### Business Rules
- Customer data must update in real-time across all systems.
- A customer is marked as "inactive" after 90 days of no engagement.

### Interfaces and Integrations
- **Shopify API Integration**: Synchronize orders and customer data between Shopify and CRM.
- **Email Integration with Mailchimp**: Automate email campaigns based on customer insights.

### Data Requirements
- Store customer data such as name, contact details, purchase history, and communication preferences.
- Ensure data consistency across CRM and e-commerce systems.

---

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- The CRM must handle up to 10,000 concurrent users with no performance degradation.
- Customer profiles should load in under 2 seconds.

### Security
- Ensure GDPR compliance for all customer data.
- Encrypt sensitive data (e.g., credit card numbers) in transit and at rest.

### Usability
- The system should have an intuitive user interface (UI) with minimal clicks to access critical customer data.

### Scalability
- The CRM should scale to support up to 100,000 customers.

### Reliability / Availability
- The CRM must maintain 99.9% uptime and have automatic backup and failover capabilities.

---

## 6. Stakeholder Requirements

### Stakeholder Needs

## 12. Shopify API Integration Code

Below is the Python code for integrating Shopify with a CRM system, as outlined in the BRD. This script fetches customer and order data from Shopify and syncs it to a CRM (currently a placeholder saving to JSON files).

    main()
```

### Usage Instructions
1. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Install the required Python package:
     ```bash
     pip install shopify==12.3.0
     ```
   - Add `shopify==12.3.0` to your `requirements.txt`.

2. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the repository root with:
     ```
     SHOPIFY_SHOP_URL=yourstore.myshopify.com
     SHOPIFY_API_KEY=your_api_key
     SHOPIFY_PASSWORD=your_api_password
     ```
   - Optionally, use `python-dotenv` to load these variables:
     ```bash
     pip install python-dotenv
     ```
     Add this to the top of the script:
     ```python
     from dotenv import load_dotenv
     load_dotenv()
     ```

3. **Run the Script**:
   - Execute the script:
     ```bash
     python shopify_integration.py
     ```
   - The script fetches customer and order data from Shopify updated in the last 24 hours and syncs it to a CRM (currently saves to `customers.json` and `orders.json` as a placeholder).

4. **Extend for Salesforce**:
   - To integrate with Salesforce (per BRD), install `simple-salesforce`:
     ```bash
     pip install simple-salesforce
     ```
   - Update the `sync_to_crm` method with Salesforce API calls, e.g.:
     ```python
     from simple_salesforce import Salesforce
     self.crm = Salesforce(username='your_username', password='your_password', security_token='your_token')
     self.crm.Contact.create({'LastName': customer['name'], 'Email': customer['email']})
     ```

### Notes
- **Real-Time Sync**: The script fetches data from the last 24 hours, aligning with the BRD's real-time update requirement.
- **Scalability**: Adjust pagination in `shopify.Customer.find()` for 100,000+ customers.
- **Security**: Add encryption (e.g., `cryptography` library) for GDPR compliance.
